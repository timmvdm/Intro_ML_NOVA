    "# Project submission\n",
    "**Due Friday May 16th before class.** Counts for 25% of the final course grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should address all the questions relevant to your project.\n",
    "You will not be graded based on the values of the model performance, but on whether or not you have applied the right methodology: formulated the business model, translated it into a right machine learning approach, analyzed your data, prepared it for modeling, applied at least 5 different machine learning algorithms, as well as neural networks, used cross validation for model tuning, justified your tuning metric, set up the proper machine learning pipeline without data leakage, evaluated your model using all the relevant metrics, interpreted your model and justified all your decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have tried different approaches, please include them all, and not just the best one.\n",
    "If doing some feature engineering has improved your model, also please include all of the steps, not just the most successful ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit the notebook with the code, output and explanations. The notebook should be executable and comprehensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The points will be deducted for the following reasons:\n",
    "- data leakage\n",
    "- unjustified decisions (no discussion on: choice of metric for optimization, blind removal of features, blind removal of outliers...)\n",
    "- notebook not comprehensible\n",
    "- notebook with incomplete output\n",
    "- notebook not executable\n",
    "- blind copy pasting from ChatGPT, if the copied code is not suitable for the task\n",
    "- writing your own code (or copy pasting them from outside source) for simple functions that we covered and that already exist in `sklearn` (train test split, plain grid search, encoding of categorical variables,...), as this leads to:\n",
    "    - convoluted code prone to bugs\n",
    "    - code that is hard to understand and review\n",
    "    - waste of data scientist's time if ready-made simple functions exist\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional points will be awarded for trying and testing different relevant approaches, from exploratory data analysis, to feature engineering, to modeling and evaluation."
